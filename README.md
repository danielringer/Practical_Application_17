The logistic regression and support vector machine models outperformed with 87% accuracy.

Logistic regression and Support Vector Machine models were successfully built to show the campaign has the capability of predicting a bank customer's interest when contacted via phone. When the models show little interest, the time spent contacting that customer would be better served with others.

### Recommendation
My recommendation is to place more focus on a bank customerâ€™s education and occupation as they appear to be closely associated with interest in the marketing campaign.
